## About The Project

Peworld is an innovative platform that provides space for recruiters to search for potential workers and for workers to find suitable career opportunities. In this project, I was fully responsible for developing the Front-End part of this website. Leveraging skills in React.js, I successfully created an intuitive and engaging user interface. The responsive design I implemented ensures a consistent and accessible user experience, both on desktop and mobile devices.
